# to_do_list

During second module of CodersLab's Front End BootCamp we were supposed to create a simple ToDoList. Although main purpose of this workshop was to improve our skills in Vanilla JavaScript, I decided to add to my project a bit of UI and created simple desing in HTML and CSS. As simple as the task may look, it was a great opportunity to work with code and learn to refactor it.
